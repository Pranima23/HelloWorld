My first project on git.

If coders were wizards in a real life, their coding skills would be their wands and their codes would be the spells they cast, wouldn't they? Here, the magic would be their creations!

I am a believer of magic in a real world, striving for success in the path of exploring the magic in myself, to be the wizard that I have always wanted to become.
